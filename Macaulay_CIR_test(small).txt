{* The example works as follows. We want to determine if the generators of H*_G map to a regular sequence in H*_S, but it is easier to do this in the ring H*_{T^5}. To determine the deficiency (which is 0 if the space is formal) it is enough to pick an element, here named Q, in the image of H^2_{T/S}, so that H*_T/(Q) = H*_S, and determine whether this Q and the generators of H*_G, viewed as Weyl-invariant elements of H*_T, generate a regular sequence. The ring H*_S // H*_G is gotten by modding out from H*_T the ideal generated by Q and a set of algebra generators of H*_G . *}

{* In turn, to determine Q, write H_1 S --> H_1 T in coordinates, and transpose to get H^2_T --> H^2_S. Then Q is an element of the kernel. *}
