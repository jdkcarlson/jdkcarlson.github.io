Hi! I'm a  topologist 
presently working as a postdoc in a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/toric">joint appointment<a/> between the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute</a> and <a href="http://uwo.ca">Western University<a/>.
<p>
I've also worked in the 
<a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/symplec/GCALSeminars.htm">symplectic geometry group</a> at the University of Toronto
and at
the <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~geometry/">geometry group</a> 
at the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo 
in a position sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/">IMPA</a>.
My dissertation at Tufts University was supervised by
<a href="http://www.tufts.edu/~ltu/">Loring Tu</a> and 
was about Borel <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300423p.pdf">equivariant cohomology</a>, 
an algebro-topological tool for studying continuous group actions, 
in my case specifically as applied to Lie group actions on homogeneous spaces. It is in the long process of being reshaped into a textbook.
<p>
My work since has continued to mostly be connected with the equivariant topology
of manifolds in some broad sense, often in collaboration with geometers.
<!-- Since those days I have been adopted by geometers. -->

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06906">Fixed points and semifree bordism</a>.
<p>
<span class="blink">
We show the ABBV localization identities completely determine the possible discrete fixed-point sets of a semifree circle action on a stably complex manifold.
This approach turns out to recover the cobordism ring of such actions (it's <b>Z</b>[<em>S</em><sup>2</sup>])
through extremely naive (19th-century&ndash;style) manipulations of combinatorial identities in about a page. 
A generalization of this approach will&mdash;God willing&mdash;enable computation of torus-equivariant 
complex cobordism in other cases as well.

with Elisheva Adina Gamse and Yael Karshon. 
<p>
<span class="blink">
The ABBV localization identities for a torus action put strong constraints on isotropy data and we show the converse, that such data must arise from a torus action on stably complex manifold.
This comes with a concrete, visually appealing construction 
in dimensions up to four, and the proof otherwise relies
on considerations connected with equivariant complex cobordism.

<span class="blink">
This work was nominally about
Borel equivariant cohomology, but in the writing became predominantly an
account of the cohomology of homogeneous spaces.
My opinion (perhaps self-serving) is that it is the fastest introduction
to this theory.
<!-- The point was to be briefer about getting to the main theorems
than the standard expositions (which it still is), 
but the length got out of hand.-->
The exposition has some things that don't appear elsewhere.
 <!-- is in part an extension and in part 
a redaction of material contained in 
 <a href="eqf_torus_I.pdf">this preprint</a>,

<!-- In it, I consider the question of for which pairs 
(<em>G</em>,<em>K</em>), of compact, connected Lie groups,
with <em>K</em> contained in <em>G</em>,
the isotropy action of <em>S</em> on <em>G</em>/<em>S</em> is 
equivariantly formal,
and am able to reduce it to the case <em>G</em> is 
simply-connected and <em>K</em> is a torus.		
Thus questions about the equivariant formality of 
isotropy actions
essentially reduce to questions about embeddings of tori.
-->
<!--		One result

<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09685">The equivariant K-theory of an isotropy action</a>. <p>


<span class="blink">
The main result of this paper establishes as corollaries the equivariant K-theory rings in basically all the known equivariantly formal examples.
We also show that under the same conditions, surjectivity of the forgetful map in K-theory
is equivalent to weak equivariant formality in the sense of Harada&ndash;Landweber.
The main tool is a map of spectral sequences from Hodgkin's K&uuml;nneth spectral sequence to the
analogous spectral sequence in Borel cohomology.

This one computes the object in the title, extending results of the first and third author.
Cohomogeneity-one actions are an important and very well-studied class 
of examples in differential geometry whose topology is determined entirely by 
an inclusion diamond of four Lie groups, so this was a natural question to ask.

Miscellaneous notes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
At one point in grad school, I decided that if I did all the exercises in 
<a href="A--M.pdf">
Atiyah &amp; Macdonald</a>,
I would become deeply knowledgeable about commutative algebra.
Though that assessment turns out to have been optimistic, I <em>am</em> now the proud owner of a
<a href="intro_comm_alg(2019).pdf">complete solution set</a> (only slightly longer than the book itself!).
<!--The document was originally set 
in a Garamond absent from my present 
<span class="tex">T<sub>E</sub>X</span>
installation, resulting in some occasional tragic miskerning in this copy, 
and worse, 
my inability to recompile the source due to several inexplicable errors.
Still, there's not much else I'd change about it.
<ul>
<li> As if sent from on high to reprimand me for my complacency, 
Hao Guo has informed me that there is an error to the solution to problem 4.6.
He suggests the following cogent emendment:
<br />
<blockquote>
"[S]ince <em>X</em> is infinite, pick an <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> in <em>X</em> 
that is different from the <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>. 
Then since the <span class="frak">q</span><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
are contained uniquely in the maximal ideals, there must exist, 
for each <span class="frak">q</span><sub><em>i</em></sub>, 
an <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
inside that does not vanish at <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, 
so that the product of these <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
will be a non-zero element inside the intersection of the <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>."
</blockquote>
-->
<li>In the literature on cohomology of fibrations,
there has long been in use a term <em>coexact</em>, 
which J. C. Moore insisted upon,
by all available accounts, due to categorical 
considerations that show the situation in question is 
dual to the familiar situation of an exact sequence.
Unpacking the argument, I found that in the relevant categories,
exactness and coexactness were actually equivalent.
I wrote this up <a href="coexactness.pdf">here</a>,
in case someone else in fact does care. 
(This was originally a letter to Larry Smith,
the "you" who occurs throughout.)




<li>
In Exercise 4.10.1 of 
their venerable <a href="DFAT.pdf">
<cite>Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology</cite></a>,
Bott &amp; Tu ask the reader to show that the image of a proper map is closed.
While a pedant might object that the claim is not actually true,
it does hold of most reasonably decent spaces. In
<a href="proper_image_2.pdf">this note</a> 
I show that it suffices the codomain be Hausdorff and
either first countable or locally compact, 
but without some sort of countability criterion, there still exist counterexamples even when the codomain is <em>T</em><sub>5</sub>.


	<!--It is an ongoing project of mine to find formulae for equivariant
		extensions, when they exist. It is well known how to do so for
		Hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds, but in more general settings
		formulae do not seem to be known.-->

<!--	<li>	Does the Weyl integration formula follow
		as a corollary of ABBV localization 
		as applied to the conjugation action of a maximal torus 
		<em>T</em> of a Lie group <em>G</em> 
		on the flag manifold <em>G</em>/<em>T</em>?
		The statements are tantalizingly similar. 
		<a href="SU(2).pdf">This note</a>, providing explicit
		equivariant extensions with respect to the natural 
		<em>S</em><sup>1</sup>-action of a maximal torus of Sp(1) 
		on Sp(1)/<em>S</em><sup>1</sup>,
		is geared toward a comparison of these two formulae.
