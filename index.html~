Hi! I'm a topologist.
I am currently on the job market following a visiting scholarship at
Tufts University.

<p>

My work has started off in dynamics on surfaces, is mostly connected with the equivariant algebraic topology of manifolds, often in collaboration with geometers,
and has expanded to have some overlap with sympectic geometry and A-infinity algebras, with some connections with Galois cohomology on the horizon.

<p>

In previous lives I've worked 
<ul>
	<li>
		as a research fellow at 
	<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/">Imperial College London</a>,
<li>
in a <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/19-20/toric">joint appointment<a/> between the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute</a> and <a href="http://uwo.ca">Western University<a/>.
				<li>
in the 
<a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/symplec/GCALSeminars.htm">symplectic geometry group</a> at the University of Toronto,
and 
<li>
in the <a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~geometry/">geometry group</a> 
at the Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo 
in a position sponsored by 
<a href="http://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/">IMPA</a>.
<li>
My dissertation at Tufts University was supervised by
<a href="http://www.tufts.edu/~ltu/">Loring Tu</a> and 
was about Borel <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201103/rtx110300423p.pdf">equivariant cohomology</a>, 
an algebro-topological tool for studying continuous group actions, 
in my case specifically as applied to Lie group actions on homogeneous spaces. It is in the long process of being reshaped into a textbook.

	<p>
<span class="blink">
Cartan computed the cohomology ring of a homogeneous space over the reals in 1949,
setting off a search for cohomology groups over a more general field which more or less concluded
in 1974.
All these approaches looked at the Eilenberg&ndash;Moore spectral sequence of a fiber bundle
where the base and total space had polynomial cohomology; Hans Munkholm's approach,
however, considered the EMSS of a pullback square with polynomial cohomology more generally,
and thus applies to Borel cohomology of a homogeneous space, 
cohomology of a biquotient, 
or cohomology of the free free loop space of a space with polynomial cohomology
over any principal ideal domain.
The answer is that it is Tor of the cohomology rings of the span of input spaces.

All these results were additive, but 
we show Munkholm's isomorphism is multiplicative,
resolving a seventy-year old question.

We show the ABBV localization identities completely determine

This approach turns out to recover the cobordism ring of such actions (it's <b>Z</b>[<em>S</em><sup>2</sup>])

Following some correspondence we have included generous background on the problem.

The ABBV localization identities for a torus action put strong constraints on isotropy data and we show the converse,

<span class="blink">
The main result of this paper establishes as corollaries the equivariant K-theory rings in basically all the known equivariantly formal examples.
We also show that under the same conditions, surjectivity of the forgetful map in K-theory
is equivalent to weak equivariant formality in the sense of Harada&ndash;Landweber.
The main tool is a map of spectral sequences from Hodgkin's K&uuml;nneth spectral sequence to the
analogous spectral sequence in Borel cohomology.

This provides the first nontrivial examples of subgroups of mapping class 
groups of different surfaces simultaneously covering, element-wise,
a subgroup of the mapping class group of a covered surface, and a lot of examples of invariants distinguishing noncommensurable elements.

Miscellaneous notes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
At one point in grad school, I decided that if I did all the exercises in 
<a href="A--M.pdf">
Atiyah &amp; Macdonald</a>,
I would become deeply knowledgeable about commutative algebra.
Though that assessment turns out to have been optimistic, I <em>am</em> now the proud owner of a
<a href="intro_comm_alg(2021).pdf">complete solution set</a> (only slightly longer than the book itself!).
<!--The document was originally set 
in a Garamond absent from my present 
<span class="tex">T<sub>E</sub>X</span>
installation, resulting in some occasional tragic miskerning in this copy, 
and worse, 
my inability to recompile the source due to several inexplicable errors.
Still, there's not much else I'd change about it.
<ul>
<li> As if sent from on high to reprimand me for my complacency, 
Hao Guo has informed me that there is an error to the solution to problem 4.6.
He suggests the following cogent emendment:
<br />
<blockquote>
"[S]ince <em>X</em> is infinite, pick an <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> in <em>X</em> 
that is different from the <em>x</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>. 
Then since the <span class="frak">q</span><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
are contained uniquely in the maximal ideals, there must exist, 
for each <span class="frak">q</span><sub><em>i</em></sub>, 
an <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
inside that does not vanish at <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, 
so that the product of these <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> 
will be a non-zero element inside the intersection of the <em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>."
</blockquote>
-->

<li>In the literature on cohomology of fibrations,
there has long been in use a term <em>coexact</em>, 
which J. C. Moore insisted upon,
by all available accounts, owing to categorical 
considerations that show the situation in question is 
dual to the familiar situation of an exact sequence.
This notion doesn't seem to get a whole lot of press,
so I wrote a brief
<a href="coexactness(2021).pdf">note</a>
expounding on the notion and the difference
from exactness, as well as conditions under which the two agree.
It was originally a letter to Larry Smith, in case a 
"you" still appears anywhere in the revised note.

<li>
In Exercise 4.10.1 of 
their venerable <a href="DFAT.pdf">
<cite>Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology</cite></a>,
Bott &amp; Tu ask the reader to show that the image of a proper map is closed.
While a pedant might object that the claim is not actually true,
it does hold of most reasonably decent spaces. In
<a href="proper_image_2.pdf">this note</a> 
I show that it suffices the codomain be Hausdorff and
either first countable or locally compact, 
but without some sort of countability criterion, there still exist counterexamples even when the codomain is <em>T</em><sub>5</sub>.


	<!--It is an ongoing project of mine to find formulae for equivariant
		extensions, when they exist. It is well known how to do so for
		Hamiltonian actions on symplectic manifolds, but in more general settings
		formulae do not seem to be known.-->

<!--	<li>	Does the Weyl integration formula follow
		as a corollary of ABBV localization 
		as applied to the conjugation action of a maximal torus 
		<em>T</em> of a Lie group <em>G</em> 
		on the flag manifold <em>G</em>/<em>T</em>?
		The statements are tantalizingly similar. 
		<a href="SU(2).pdf">This note</a>, providing explicit
		equivariant extensions with respect to the natural 
		<em>S</em><sup>1</sup>-action of a maximal torus of Sp(1) 
		on Sp(1)/<em>S</em><sup>1</sup>,
		is geared toward a comparison of these two formulae.

Teaching
</h2>
<ul>
<!-- I am not teaching over this summer. -->
I taught commutative algebra at Imperial in Autumn 2021 and 
was compelled to transcribe <a href="https://u.pcloud.link/publink/show?code=XZOCpLVZB5GlhAgxSJS2psOr9yTSRFf2fwak">complete lecture notes</a>,
reproduced here for your approval.
<!-- And <a href="comm_alg_ICL">here</a> are the problem sets and solutions. -->

<p>
I also once overwrote a number of <a href="integral_people.pdf">word problems</a> 
which were received with some mixture of enthusiasm and confusion
in a vector calculus course at the University of Toronto at Mississauga.<br />

<!-- I am not teaching this semester.-->

<!--
This year, I am teaching a section of Calculus, MAT135, at U. of T. Mississauga.
